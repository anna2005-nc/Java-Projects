This is my text-based recreation of the Tony Hawk Pro Skater game. It allows the user to input commands and will print out the resulting trick. The game includes a trick directory to guide the user and a tutorial to learn how to input commands. There is also a helpful tips menu if they get stuck. The user can choose to play in a variety of different locations as different pro skaters and they can gather points for executing tricks. The more difficult the trick is, the less likely it is to be landed. If they don't land the trick, they won't receive any points. The user can view a menu of their stats which displays their total points and the number of tricks they have done.
