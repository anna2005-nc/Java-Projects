This is my online library catalog. It allows the user to create an account as either a librarian or a reader. A librarian is able to select and display featured books and authors, as well as add new books to the catalog and plan library events. A reader can log into the system and view the featured book and author and the upcoming library events. They can also search the catalog by author and by title and view the details of the results.
