This is a work in progress of a text-based recreation of the travel website Expedia. The website can schedule and book flights. It has a userbase that is madeup of airlines and passengers. The airlines can create flights and set prices for them and the passengers can book those flights. When the website is opened, the user can choose to either sign in or create an account. Once they have logged in successfully, if they are a passenger they have the option to either book, cancel, or check the status of a flight. If they are an airline they can schedule new flights and check to see how many bookings they have. The user can search a flightbase of the offered flights and choose one from their location heading to their destination. 

This project was created so I could learn to read and write JSON.
